<h1>Hi people ðŸ‘‹</h1>

I am a Data Scientist/Backend developer passionate for learning a new technologies.
The reason I have chosen Data Science is the number of discoveries it can help the humanity to make and how many opportunities it can give to make our lives easier.

Previously educated as an urban planner at SPbUACE (2013 - 2018, B.Arch.), I have worked as an urban planner for two years when decided to change my occupation.
Currently, I am studying at Master's level at ITMO University (2022 - 2024).

In a spare time I enjoy hiking and listening to music. My favourite food is khinkali. I can easily distinguish a good one and a bad one.

See my [Portfolio](https://arthurkazaryan.github.io/portfolio/) and [CV](https://arthurkazaryan.github.io/cv/) for more information. Feel free to get in touch!
